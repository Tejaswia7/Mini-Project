	Automatic pain recognition plays a vital role in healthcare. Traditional methods rely on expert-designed features extracted from physiological signals, which can be time-consuming and expertise-dependent. 
 This project introduces a deep learning approach that automates both feature extraction and classification, eliminating the need for medical expertise. 
 The proposed method utilizes multi-level context information, which significantly improves performance compared to uni-level context information. 
 Experiments conducted on the BioVid Heat Pain Database and EmoPain 2021 dataset demonstrate superior results. In distinguishing between Pain 0 (no pain) and Pain 4 (high pain), 
 the model achieved 98.5% accuracy for 87 subjects and 98.5% accuracy for 67 subjects using Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation. This deep learning approach effectively enhances pain recognition 
 performance.
